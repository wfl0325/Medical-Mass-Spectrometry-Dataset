In terms of pharmacodynamics, Generally, the actinomycins exert an inhibitory effect on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and on some fungi. However, the toxic properties of the actinomycins (including dactinomycin) in relation to antibacterial activity are such as to preclude their use as antibiotics in the treatment of infectious diseases. Because the actinomycins are cytotoxic, they have an antineoplastic effect which has been demonstrated in experimental animals with various types of tumor implant. This cytotoxic action is the basis for their use in the treatment of certain types of cancer. Dactinomycin is believed to produce its cytotoxic effects by binding DNA and inhibiting RNA synthesis..

In terms of pharmacodynamics, In a phase I study, 37 patients with a variety of solid-tumor cancers refractory to therapy received 50 to 300 mg of crizotinib daily or twice daily. In this group, two patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exhibiting echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations responded to therapy; therefore, following studies focused on patients with advanced ALK-positive disease.1 In this group of patients, the 6-month progression-free survival among crizotinib users was approximately 72%. When compared to ALK mutation-positive patients that did not receive crizotinib, ALK mutation-positive patients treated with crizotinib had a higher two-year overall survival rate (54% vs 36%).1The use of crizotinib may lead to hepatotoxicity, interstitial lung disease (ILD), pneumonitis, QT interval prolongation, bradycardia, severe visual loss, ​​embryo-fetal toxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity in pediatric and young adult patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) or pediatric patients with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT).4.
The mechanism of action involves Crizotinib is a tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor that targets anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR, c-MET), ROS1 (c-ros), and Recepteur d'Origine Nantais (RON).4 When activated, ALK inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell proliferation, and ALK-gene translocations can lead to the expression of oncogenic fusion proteins. A small portion of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have ALK-positive tumors. Most of these cases are characterized by the fusion of ALK with the chimeric protein echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4), resulting in increased kinase activity.1,4 Crizotinib inhibits ALK by inhibiting its phosphorylation and creating an inactive protein conformation.3 This ultimately lowers the proliferation of cells carrying this genetic mutation and tumour survivability.4 In vitro assays on tumor cell lines demonstrated that crizotinib inhibits ALK, ROS1, and c-Met phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner. In vivo studies in mice with tumor xenografts that expressed EML4- or nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK fusion proteins or c-Met showed that crizotinib has antitumor activity.4TargetActionsOrganismAALK tyrosine kinase receptorinhibitorHumansAHepatocyte growth factor receptorinhibitorHumansAProto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROSinhibitorHumansAMacrophage-stimulating protein receptorinhibitorHumans.
Crizotinib is In patients with pancreatic, colorectal, sarcoma, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with crizotinib doses ranging from 100 mg once a day to 300 mg twice a day, the mean AUC and Cmax increased in a dose-proportional manner.2 A single crizotinib dose of crizotinib is absorbed with a median tmax 4 to 6 hours.4 In patients receiving multiple doses of crizotinib 250 mg twice daily (n=167), the mean AUC was is 2321.00 ng⋅hr/mL, the mean Cmax was 99.60 ng/mL, and the median tmax was 5.0 hours.1 The mean absolute bioavailability of crizotinib is 43%, ranging from 32% to 66%. High-fat meals reduce the AUC0-INF and Cmax of crizotinib by approximately 14%.4 Age, sex at birth, and ethnicity (Asian vs non-Asian patients) did not have a clinically significant effect on crizotinib pharmacokinetics. In patients less than 18 years old, higher body weight was associated with a lower crizotinib exposure.4 and its volume of distribution is Following a single intravenous dose, the mean volume of distribution (Vss) of crizotinib was 1772 L.4.
It has a protein binding rate of Crizotinib is 91% bound to plasma protein. In vitro studies suggest that this is not affected by drug concentration.4 and is metabolized hepatically, with a half-life of Following single doses of crizotinib, the plasma terminal half-life was 42 hours.4.
The drug has a reported toxicity of The maximum tolerated dose of crizotinib is the same as the recommended dosing regimen (250 mg twice daily). This was defined based on a phase 1 dose-escalation study in patients with advanced solid tumors. The treatment of crizotinib overdoses should consist of symptomatic treatment and other supportive measures. There is no antidote for crizotinib.6 In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that crizotinib is genotoxic, and the Ames test showed that crizotinib was not mutagenic. Carcinogenicity studies with crizotinib have not been performed.4 In female rats, 500 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) of crizotinib for 3 days induced single-cell necrosis of ovarian follicles. In male rats, 50 mg/kg/day of crizotinib (greater than 1.7 times the recommended human dose) for 28 days induced testicular pachytene spermatocyte degeneration.4.Finally, it Categories belongs to the AminopyridinesAnaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitorsAntineoplastic AgentsAntineoplastic and Immunomodulating AgentsBradycardia-Causing AgentsCytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 InhibitorsCytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inhibitors (strength unknown)Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A InhibitorsCytochrome P-450 CYP3A SubstratesCytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 InhibitorsCytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (moderate)Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (strength unknown)Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 SubstratesCytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic IndexCytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 InhibitorsCytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inhibitors (strength unknown)Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 SubstratesCytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic IndexCytochrome P-450 Enzyme InhibitorsCytochrome P-450 SubstratesEnzyme InhibitorsKinase InhibitorModerate Risk QTc-Prolonging AgentsNarrow Therapeutic Index DrugsOCT2 InhibitorsOrganic Cation Transporter 1 InhibitorsP-glycoprotein inhibitorsP-glycoprotein substratesP-glycoprotein substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic IndexPiperidinesProtein Kinase InhibitorsPyridinesQTc Prolonging AgentsReceptor Tyrosine Kinase InhibitorsTyrosine Kinase Inhibitors category.

In terms of pharmacodynamics, Bexarotene is a member of a subclass of retinoids that selectively activate retinoid X receptors (RXRs). These retinoid receptors have biologic activity distinct from that of retinoic acid receptors (RARs). Bexarotene is indicated for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients who are refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy. Bexarotene selectively binds and activates retinoid X receptor subtypes (RXRα, RXRβ, RXRγ). RXRs can form heterodimers with various receptor partners such as retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, thyroid receptor, and peroxisome proliferator activator receptors (PPARs). Once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control cellular differentiation and proliferation. Bexarotene inhibits the growth in vitro of some tumor cell lines of hematopoietic and squamous cell origin. It also induces tumor regression in vivo in some animal models..
The mechanism of action involves Bexarotene selectively binds with and activates retinoid X receptor subtypes. There are three subtypes in total: RXRα, RXRβ, RXRγ.

In terms of pharmacodynamics, Lurbinectedin exerts its chemotherapeutic activity by covalently binding to DNA, resulting in double-strand DNA breaks and subsequent cell death.1 Lurbinectedin has been associated with myelosuppression, and patients receiving therapy with this agent should be closely monitored for evidence of cytopenias. Prior to beginning therapy, ensure baseline neutrophil counts are >1,500 cells/mm3 and platelet counts are >100,000/mm3.7 The supplementary use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) should be considered if the neutrophil count falls below 500 cells/mm3.7 Lurbinectedin has also been associated with hepatotoxicity.7 Monitor liver function tests at baseline and regular intervals throughout therapy, and consider holding, reducing, or permanently discontinuing therapy based on the severity of observed hepatotoxicity.7.
The mechanism of action involves Lurbinectedin is a DNA alkylating agent.7 It covalently binds to guanine residues in the DNA minor groove, forming adducts that bend the DNA helix towards the major groove. This process triggers a cascade of events that affect the activity of transcription factors and impairs DNA repair pathways, ultimately leading to double-strand DNA breaks and eventual cell death.7,1 Additional mechanism(s) of action include inhibition of RNA-polymerase-II activity, inactivation of Ewing Sarcoma Oncoprotein (EWS-FL11) via nuclear redistribution, and the inhibition of human monocyte activity and macrophage infiltration into tumor tissue.7,1TargetActionsOrganismUDNAadductHumans.

In terms of pharmacodynamics, Vincristine is a vinca alkaloid antineoplastic agent used as a treatment for various cancers including breast cancer, Hodgkin's disease, Kaposi's sarcoma, and testicular cancer. The vinca alkaloids are structurally similar compounds comprised of 2 multiringed units, vindoline and catharanthine. The vinca alkaloids have become clinically useful since the discovery of their antitumour properties in 1959. Initially, extracts of the periwinkle plant (Catharanthus roseus) were investigated because of putative hypoglycemic properties, but were noted to cause marrow suppression in rats and antileukemic effects in vitro. Vincristine binds to the microtubular proteins of the mitotic spindle, leading to crystallization of the microtubule and mitotic arrest or cell death. Vincristine has some immunosuppressant effect. The vinca alkaloids are considered to be cell cycle phase-specific..
The mechanism of action involves The antitumor activity of Vincristine is thought to be due primarily to inhibition of mitosis at metaphase through its interaction with tubulin. Like other vinca alkaloids, Vincristine may also interfere with: 1) amino acid, cyclic AMP, and glutathione metabolism, 2) calmodulin-dependent Ca2+-transport ATPase activity, 3) cellular respiration, and 4) nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis.TargetActionsOrganismATubulin beta chaininhibitorHumansUTubulin alpha-4A chaininhibitorHumans.

In terms of pharmacodynamics, Sirolimus is an immunosuppressant drug with antifungal and antitumour effects.2 In animal models, sirolimus prolonged allograft survival following various organ transplants and reversed an acute rejection of heart and kidney allografts in rats. Upon oral administration of 2 mg/day and 5 mg/day, sirolimus significantly reduced the incidence of organ rejection in low- to moderate-immunologic risk renal transplant patients at six months following transplantation compared with either azathioprine or placebo. In some studies, the immunosuppressive effect of sirolimus lasted up to six months after discontinuation of therapy: this tolerization effect is alloantigen-specific.8 Sirolimus potently inhibits antigen-induced proliferation of T cells, B cells, and antibody production.3In rodent models of autoimmune disease, sirolimus suppressed immune-mediated events associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, collagen-induced arthritis, autoimmune type I diabetes, autoimmune myocarditis, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, graft-versus-host disease, and autoimmune uveoretinitis.8.
The mechanism of action involves Sirolimus works by inhibiting T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation stimulated by antigens and cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and IL-15. In target cells, sirolimus binds to the cytoplasmic receptor FK506-binding protein-12 (FKBP12), an immunophilin, to form an immunosuppressive complex. FKBP12-sirolimus complex binds to and inhibits the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR),2,8 which is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that regulates cell growth, proliferation, survival, mobility, and angiogenesis.1,2 mTOR regulates the downstream signalling pathways involved in cell survival, such as the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling pathway.1 Inhibition of mTOR leads to the suppression of cytokine-driven T-cell proliferation, thus the progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle is inhibited. Sirolimus also inhibits antibody production. In vitro, sirolimus and other mTOR inhibitors inhibit the production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability.8 Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a disorder that primarily affects the lungs. It is characterized by lung tissue infiltration, unregulated alveolar smooth muscle proliferation, and cystic destruction of parenchyma. Although infrequent, it occurs as a symptomatic pulmonary complication in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in TSC genes.7 Loss of functional TSC gene leads to the aberrant activation of the mTOR signalling pathway, resulting in cellular proliferation and release of lymphangiogenic growth factors. Sirolimus inhibits the activated mTOR pathway and proliferation of alveolar smooth muscle cell proliferation.8TargetActionsOrganismASerine/threonine-protein kinase mTORinhibitorHumans.
Sirolimus is In adult renal transplant patients with low- to moderate-immunologic risk, oral administration of 2 mg sirolimus led to a Cmax of 14.4 ± 5.3 ng/mL for oral solution and 15.0 ± 4.9 ng/mL for oral tablets. The tmax was 2.1 ± 0.8 hours for oral solution and 3.5 ± 2.4 hours for oral tablets. In healthy subjects, the tmax is one hour. In a multi-dose study, steady-state was reached six days following repeated twice-daily administration without an initial loading dose, with the average trough concentration of sirolimus increased approximately 2- to 3-fold. It is suspected that a loading dose of three times the maintenance dose will provide near steady-state concentrations within one day in most patients.8The systemic availability of sirolimus is approximately 14%. In healthy subjects, the mean bioavailability of sirolimus after administration of the tablet is approximately 27% higher relative to the solution. Sirolimus tablets are not bioequivalent to the solution; however, clinical equivalence has been demonstrated at the 2 mg dose level. Sirolimus concentrations, following the administration of Rapamune Oral Solution to stable renal transplant patients, are dose-proportional between 3 and 12 mg/m2.8 and its volume of distribution is The mean (± SD) blood-to-plasma ratio of sirolimus was 36 ± 18 L in stable renal allograft patients, indicating that sirolimus is extensively partitioned into formed blood elements. The mean volume of distribution (Vss/F) of sirolimus is 12 ± 8 L/kg.8.
It has a protein binding rate of Sirolimus is 92% bound to human plasma proteins, mainly serum albumin (97%), α1-acid glycoprotein, and lipoproteins.8 and is metabolized hepatically, with a half-life of The mean ± SD terminal elimination half-life (t½) of sirolimus after multiple dosing in stable renal transplant patients was estimated to be about 62 ± 16 hours.8.
The drug has a reported toxicity of Oral LD50 of sirolimus is 800 mg/kg in rats and 2500 mg/kg in mouse.12Sirolimus is a narrow therapeutic index drug.5 Although there are reports of overdose with sirolimus, there is limited information on overdose in the clinical setting. Symptoms of overdose are consistent with the adverse effects of sirolimus. General supportive measures are recommended in the event of an overdose. Because sirolimus has low aqueous solubility and high erythrocyte and plasma protein binding, it is not expected to be dialyzable to any significant extent.8.Finally, it Categories belongs to the Agents causing angioedemaAnti-Bacterial AgentsAnti-Infective AgentsAntibiotics, AntineoplasticAntifungal AgentsAntineoplastic and Immunomodulating AgentsCytochrome P-450 CYP3A SubstratesCytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 SubstratesCytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic IndexCytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 SubstratesCytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic IndexCytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 SubstratesCytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic IndexCytochrome P-450 SubstratesDecreased Immunologic ActivityHyperglycemia-Associated AgentsImmunologic FactorsImmunosuppressive AgentsImmunotherapyKinase InhibitorLactonesMacrolidesmTOR Inhibitor ImmunosuppressantmTOR InhibitorsMyelosuppressive AgentsNarrow Therapeutic Index DrugsOATP1B1/SLCO1B1 InhibitorsOphthalmologicalsP-glycoprotein inducersP-glycoprotein inhibitorsP-glycoprotein substratesP-glycoprotein substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic IndexPolyketidesProtein Kinase InhibitorsSelective ImmunosuppressantsSensory OrgansSirolimus and Prodrugs category.

In terms of pharmacodynamics, Upregulates the expression of MHC I proteins, allowing for increased presentation of peptides derived from viral antigens. This enhances the activation of CD8+ T cells that are the precursors for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and makes the macrophage a better target for CTL-mediated killing. Interferon alpha also induce the synthesis of several key antiviral mediators, including 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (2'-5' A synthetase) and protein kinase R..
The mechanism of action involves Interferon alpha binds to type I interferon receptors (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c) which, upon dimerization, activate two Jak (Janus kinase) tyrosine kinases (Jak1 and Tyk2). These transphosphorylate themselves and phosphorylate the receptors. The phosphorylated INFAR receptors then bind to Stat1 and Stat2 (signal transducers and activators of transcription) which dimerize and activate multiple (~100) immunomodulatory and antiviral proteins. Interferon alpha binds less stably to type I interferon receptors than interferon beta. The resulting actions include gene transcription, inhibition of cellular growth, alteration of the state of cellular differentiation, interference with oncogene expression, alteration of cell surface antigen expression, increasing phagocytic activity of macrophages, and augmentation of the cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells.TargetActionsOrganismAInterferon alpha/beta receptor 1binderHumansAInterferon alpha/beta receptor 2binderHumans.

In terms of pharmacodynamics, Vinblastine is a vinca alkaloid antineoplastic agent. The vinca alkaloids are structurally similar compounds comprised of 2 multiringed units: vindoline and catharanthine. The vinca alkaloids have become clinically useful since the discovery of their antitumour properties in 1959. Initially, extracts of the periwinkle plant (Catharanthus roseus) were investigated because of putative hypoglycemic properties, but were noted to cause marrow suppression in rats and antileukemic effects in vitro. Vinblastine has some immunosuppressant effect. The vinca alkaloids are considered to be cell cycle phase-specific..
The mechanism of action involves The antitumor activity of vinblastine is thought to be due primarily to inhibition of mitosis at metaphase through its interaction with tubulin. Vinblastine binds to the microtubular proteins of the mitotic spindle, leading to crystallization of the microtubule and mitotic arrest or cell death.TargetActionsOrganismATubulin alpha-1A chainbinderHumansATubulin beta chainbinderHumansATubulin delta chainbinderHumansATubulin gamma-1 chainbinderHumansATubulin epsilon chainbinderHumansNTranscription factor AP-1other/unknownHumans.

In terms of pharmacodynamics, Two of the rings in the drug's structure allows it to covalently bind to the minor groove of DNA. The third ring protrudes from the DNA which lets it interact with nearby nuclear proteins. This has the additive effect of blocking cell division at the G2 phase..
The mechanism of action involves Trabectedin interacts with the minor groove of DNA and alkylates guanine at the N2 position, which bends towards the major groove. In this manner, it is thought that the drug affects various transcription factors involved in cell proliferation, particularly via the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair system. Trabectedin blocks the cell cycle at the G2 phase, while cells at the G1 phase are most sensitive to the drug. It also inhibits overexpression of the multidrug resistance-1 gene (MDR-1) coding for the P-glycoprotein that is a major factor responsible for cells developing resistance to cancer drugs.

In terms of pharmacodynamics, Tasonermin is thought to contribute to the destruction of tumor tissue via several direct and indirect effects Label. Tasonermin directly inhibits cell proliferation in a variety of cancer cells. It also modifies endothelial cell morphology and reduces their proliferation in tumor microvasculature. Modification of the expression of cell adhesion proteins, proteins affecting coagulation, interleukins, and hematopoietic growth factors favors a procoagulant state resulting in microvascular thrombosis. These changes also increase infiltration of the tumor tissue by leukocytes. Monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes are activated allowing better adherence to the endothelium and subjecting the tumor cells to phagocytosis and respiratory bursts as well as producing degranulation of immune cells to further enhance inflammatory activity. Active antigen presenting cells are able to activate and induce proliferation of T- and B-lymphocyte cells to allow the adaptive immune system to contribute to tumor cell damage.These changes lead to hemorraghic necrosis of the tumor..
The mechanism of action involves Since tasonermin is recombinant TNF-α, it functions exactly as endogenous TNF-α does. The direct cytotoxic effect of TNF-α is mediated by TNF-α receptor 1 2. The bound receptor activates the well-reviewed death receptor pathway involving the activation of initiator caspases 8 and 9 then ultimately ending in the activation of effector caspase 3 which begins the process of apoptosis.The effect on tumor vasculature is mediated by the inflammatory signalling pathway of TNF-α, the NFκB pathway 2. This pathway is also activated by TNFR1 when bound to TNFα. The NFκB transcription factor increases expression of proteins in vascular endothelial cells. These proteins include cell adhesion molecules, inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and interleukins, and growth factors 4. TNF-&alpha also increases the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase via this pathway which contributes to the generation of reactive nitrogen species 3. These species are able to damage cells in the tumor and microvasculature.The cytokines produced from NFκB activation and TNF-&aplha; itself serve to activate the cells of the immune system which further damage tumor cells with respiratory bursts, phagocytosis and subsequent breakdown of the cell, and release of cytotoxic enzymes. The antigen presenting cells which phagocytose the tumor cells are able to activate lymphocytes and allow the adaptive immune system to further damage the tumor tissue 5.TargetActionsOrganismATumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1AagonistHumansUTumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1BagonistHumans.

In terms of pharmacodynamics, Paclitaxel is a taxoid antineoplastic agent indicated as first-line and subsequent therapy for the treatment of advanced carcinoma of the ovary, and other various cancers including breast cancer. Paclitaxel is a novel antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization. This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or "bundles" of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis..
The mechanism of action involves Paclitaxel interferes with the normal function of microtubule growth. Whereas drugs like colchicine cause the depolymerization of microtubules in vivo, paclitaxel arrests their function by having the opposite effect; it hyper-stabilizes their structure. This destroys the cell's ability to use its cytoskeleton in a flexible manner. Specifically, paclitaxel binds to the β subunit of tubulin. Tubulin is the "building block" of mictotubules, and the binding of paclitaxel locks these building blocks in place. The resulting microtubule/paclitaxel complex does not have the ability to disassemble. This adversely affects cell function because the shortening and lengthening of microtubules (termed dynamic instability) is necessary for their function as a transportation highway for the cell. Chromosomes, for example, rely upon this property of microtubules during mitosis. Further research has indicated that paclitaxel induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cancer cells by binding to an apoptosis stopping protein called Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia 2) and thus arresting its function.TargetActionsOrganismATubulin beta-1 chaininhibitorHumansAApoptosis regulator Bcl-2inhibitorHumansAMicrotubule-associated protein 4Not AvailableHumansAMicrotubule-associated protein 2Not AvailableHumansAMicrotubule-associated protein tauNot AvailableHumansUNuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2inducerHumans.

Tibolone known generically as Tibolone. According to DrugBank, its accession number is DB09070.
Tibolone is a synthetic steroid hormone drug, which is mainly non-selective in its binding profile, acting as an agonist primarily at estrogen receptors (ER), with a preference for ER alpha 11.Tibolone (Livial, Org OD 14), produced by Organon (West Orange, NJ), is a synthetic steroid that possesses estrogenic, androgenic and progestogenic properties. It has been used in Europe for almost 2 decades, primarily for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis and the treatment of post-menopausal symptoms 4. Tibolone is approved in 90 countries to manage menopausal symptoms and in 45 countries to prevent the development of osteoporosis 12.In June 2006, Organon Pharmaceuticals announced the receipt of a Not Approvable Letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), advising the company that the New Drug Application (NDA) for tibolone had not been approved 5.Interestingly, the use of tibolone in the treatment cardiovascular disease has been studied with inconclusive results 2.

In terms of pharmacodynamics, Tibolone prevents bone loss and treating post-menopausal symptoms without stimulating the endometrial tissues, which may lead to malignancy. Typical, drugs that treat post-menopausal symptoms such as estrogen, have a proliferative effect on the endometrium, increasing the risk of endometrial carcinoma 8. The effects on the bone, brain and vaginal tissues can be explained by the estrogenic activity of tibolone. It is important to note that activity is not expressed in the endometrium. Tibolone behaves differently from estrogen plus progesterone combinations on the breast. Therefore, tibolone can be characterized as a selective estrogen activity regulator 1.Tibolone has been demonstrated to be an effective agent in treating symptoms associated with menopause. A 16 week trial in 1189 women examined the effect of tibolone 2.5 mg once daily on climacteric symptoms. Women treated with tibolone showed improvement from baseline in typical menopausal symptoms including hot flashes, sweating, insomnia, and anxiety 14..
The mechanism of action involves This drug's effects are owed to the activity of its metabolites in various tissues 4.Upon ingestion, tibolone is quickly converted into three major metabolites: 3 alpha- and 3 beta-hydroxy-tibolone, which have oestrogenic effects, and the Delta(4)-isomer, which has progestogenic and androgenic effects. The specific tissue-selective effects of tibolone occur due to the metabolism, regulation of enzymes and receptor activation that varies in different tissues of the body.The bone-conserving effects occur due to estradiol receptor activation, while the progesterone and androgen receptors are not involved in this process. Breast tissue of monkeys is not found to be stimulated after tibolone administration, as occurs with estrogen plus progesterone used in combination. This is explained by the fact that tibolone and its metabolites inhibit sulphatase and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) type I and stimulate sulphotransferase and 17 beta-HSD type II. The combined effects of this process prevent the conversion to active estrogens.In the uterus, the progestogenic activity of the Delta(4)-metabolite and the effect on estrogen-inactivating enzymes prevent estrogenic stimulation. The mammary gland is not stimulated in currently used animal models. Tibolone has been shown to regulate estrogenic activity in several tissue types by influencing the availability of estrogenic compounds for the estradiol receptor in a selective manner 2.Additionally, tibolone modulates cellular homeostasis in the breast by preventing breast tissue proliferation and stimulating cell apoptosis. Tibolone does not stimulate the endometrium because of the action of its highly stable progestogenic metabolite (Delta(4)-isomer) in combination with an effect on the sulfatase (inhibition)-sulfotransferase (stimulation) system. The estrogenic metabolites of tibolone have direct, favorable effects on the cardiovascular system and, in animal models, this drug has shown no adverse consequences. The tissue-selective effects of tibolone are the result of metabolism, enzyme regulation and receptor activation that vary in different tissues. The bone-preserving effects of tibolone are the result of estradiol receptor activation, while other steroid receptors, mainly the progesterone and androgen receptors, are not involved in this process. In a study of monkeys, breast tissue was not stimulated, which occurs with estrogen and progesterone, because tibolone and its metabolites inhibit sulfatase and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid _dehydrogenase (HSD) type I and stimulate _sulfotransferase and 17 beta-HSD type II. The simultaneous effects of this process halt conversion to active estrogens. Additionally, tibolone affects cellular homeostasis in the breast by preventing proliferation and stimulating apoptosis. Tibolone does not stimulate the endometrium due to the action of the highly stable progestogenic metabolite (Delta(4)-isomer) in combination with an effect on the sulphatase (inhibition)-sulphotransferase (stimulation) pathway 1.The levels of tibolone metabolites and the alteration of hormonal activities vary according to the tissue type. In endometrial tissue the Δ4-isomer functions as a progestagen, however, in the brain and liver, it shows androgenic effects. In breast tissue, the primary actions of tibolone are strong inhibition of sulfatase activity and weak inhibition of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, which leads to blocking the conversion estrone sulfate to E2 4.TargetActionsOrganismAEstrogen receptor alphaantagonistagonistHumans.
Tibolone is Tibolone is extensively and rapidly absorbed after oral administration 14. The parent drug undergoes extensive metabolism, with. Greater than 80% of a radioactive dose excreted from the body as metabolites, which suggests very low plasma concentrations of tibolone. Plasma concentrations of the metabolites appear within 30 minutes and peak within 1–1.5 hours.2,7 The plasma concentrations of the hydroxymetabolites are higher than those of the ∆4-isomer. Food does not appear to have an effect on the absorption of this drug 14. and its volume of distribution is Not Available.

The results indicated that the increase in the incidence of breast cancer with estrogen and progestogen (compared to estrogen alone) was greater than the reduction in occurrence of endometrial cancer associated with adding progestogen to estrogen therapy. The MWS also reported a marked increase in the incidence of breast cancer with tibolone and with implanted and transdermal estrogen-only preparations 6.Tibolone treatment in rodent studies showed an increased association with the development of a range of tumors in long-term oral carcinogenicity studies. These tumors included pituitary adenomas, mammary carcinomas and fibroadenomas, hepatic adenomas, uterine carcinoma, stromal polyps and stromal sarcoma, and carcinomas of the urinary bladder and testes.

In terms of pharmacodynamics, Due to its mechanism of action, palbociclib inhibits cell growth and suppresses DNA replication in retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (RB) proficient cancer cells. As expected, these RB cells present a significant increase in the proportion of cells in G1 state and the presence of palbociclib produces effective dephosphorylation of RB, reduce proliferation and induce senescence causing cell-cycle arrest.5In vitro studies showed the potential for palbociclib to reduce cellular proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines through the inhibition of the cell-cycle progression from G1 to S phase. In this study, it was demonstrated that the sensitivity of the cells significantly increased with the expression of RB1 and CCND1 and low expression of CDKN2A. As well, palbociclib, combined with antiestrogens, enhanced in vivo antitumor activity in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer mouse models.3In clinical trials, palbociclib, in combination with letrozole, was shown to significantly increase the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic breast cancer without prior endocrine treatment. In the results, the PFS increased from 4.5 to 9.5 months with an overall response rate (ORR) of 24.6%.2.
The mechanism of action involves Palbociclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor1 that acts by binding to the ATP pocket with an IC50 in the range of 9-15 nmol/L. It is important to consider that it presents low to absent activity against other kinases.4 The CDK4/6 kinase is involved, with coregulatory partner cyclin D, in the G1-S transition. Hence, inhibition of this step prevents cell cycle progression in cells in whose this pathway is functioning. This step includes the pathways of the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and the E2F family of transcription factors.4TargetActionsOrganismACyclin-dependent kinase 4inhibitorHumansACyclin-dependent kinase 6inhibitorHumans.
