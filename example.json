It binds to DNA and inhibits RNA synthesis (transcription), with chain elongation more sensitive than initiation, termination, or release. As a result of impaired mRNA production, protein synthesis also declines after dactinomycin therapy. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1993, p2015)",

            "Pharmacodynamics": "Generally, the actinomycins exert an inhibitory effect on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and on some fungi. However, the toxic properties of the actinomycins (including dactinomycin) in relation to antibacterial activity are such as to preclude their use as antibiotics in the treatment of infectious diseases. Because the actinomycins are cytotoxic, they have an antineoplastic effect which has been demonstrated in experimental animals with various types of tumor implant. This cytotoxic action is the basis for their use in the treatment of certain types of cancer. Dactinomycin is believed to produce its cytotoxic effects by binding DNA and inhibiting RNA synthesis.",

Second- and third-generation ALK-tyrosine kinase-inhibitors have overcome many of the pharmacodynamic and genetic resistance mechanisms crizotinib is prone to.3 Crizotinib was approved by the FDA in 2011, and its use is accompanied by FDA-approved tests used to detect ALK and ROS1 rearrangements.4",

            "Pharmacodynamics": "In a phase I study, 37 patients with a variety of solid-tumor cancers refractory to therapy received 50 to 300 mg of crizotinib daily or twice daily. In this group, two patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exhibiting echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations responded to therapy; therefore, following studies focused on patients with advanced ALK-positive disease.1 In this group of patients, the 6-month progression-free survival among crizotinib users was approximately 72%. When compared to ALK mutation-positive patients that did not receive crizotinib, ALK mutation-positive patients treated with crizotinib had a higher two-year overall survival rate (54% vs 36%).1The use of crizotinib may lead to hepatotoxicity, interstitial lung disease (ILD), pneumonitis, QT interval prolongation, bradycardia, severe visual loss, ​​embryo-fetal toxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity in pediatric and young adult patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) or pediatric patients with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT).4",
            "Mechanism of action": "Crizotinib is a tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor that targets anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR, c-MET), ROS1 (c-ros), and Recepteur d'Origine Nantais (RON).4 When activated, ALK inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell proliferation, and ALK-gene translocations can lead to the expression of oncogenic fusion proteins. A small portion of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have ALK-positive tumors. Most of these cases are characterized by the fusion of ALK with the chimeric protein echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4), resulting in increased kinase activity.1,4 Crizotinib inhibits ALK by inhibiting its phosphorylation and creating an inactive protein conformation.3 This ultimately lowers the proliferation of cells carrying this genetic mutation and tumour survivability.4 In vitro assays on tumor cell lines demonstrated that crizotinib inhibits ALK, ROS1, and c-Met phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner. In vivo studies in mice with tumor xenografts that expressed EML4- or nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK fusion proteins or c-Met showed that crizotinib has antitumor activity.4TargetActionsOrganismAALK tyrosine kinase receptorinhibitorHumansAHepatocyte growth factor receptorinhibitorHumansAProto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROSinhibitorHumansAMacrophage-stimulating protein receptorinhibitorHumans",
            "Absorption": "In patients with pancreatic, colorectal, sarcoma, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with crizotinib doses ranging from 100 mg once a day to 300 mg twice a day, the mean AUC and Cmax increased in a dose-proportional manner.2 A single crizotinib dose of crizotinib is absorbed with a median tmax 4 to 6 hours.4 In patients receiving multiple doses of crizotinib 250 mg twice daily (n=167), the mean AUC was is 2321.00 ng⋅hr/mL, the mean Cmax was 99.60 ng/mL, and the median tmax was 5.0 hours.1 The mean absolute bioavailability of crizotinib is 43%, ranging from 32% to 66%. High-fat meals reduce the AUC0-INF and Cmax of crizotinib by approximately 14%.4 Age, sex at birth, and ethnicity (Asian vs non-Asian patients) did not have a clinically significant effect on crizotinib pharmacokinetics. In patients less than 18 years old, higher body weight was associated with a lower crizotinib exposure.4",
            "Volume of distribution": "Following a single intravenous dose, the mean volume of distribution (Vss) of crizotinib was 1772 L.4",
            "Protein binding": "Crizotinib is 91% bound to plasma protein. In vitro studies suggest that this is not affected by drug concentration.4",
            "Metabolism": "Crizotinib is mainly metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, and undergoes an O-dealkylation, with subsequent phase 2 conjugation.1 Non-metabolic elimination, such as biliary excretion, can not be excluded.5 PF-06260182 (with two constituent diastereomers, PF-06270079 and PF-06270080) is the only active metabolite of crizotinib that has been identified. In vitro studies suggest that, compared to crizotinib, PF-06270079 and PF-06270080 are approximately 3- to 8-fold less potent against anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and 2.5- to 4-fold less potent against Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor (HGFR, c-Met).5Hover over products below to view reaction partnersCrizotinibPF-06260182",

This was defined based on a phase 1 dose-escalation study in patients with advanced solid tumors. The treatment of crizotinib overdoses should consist of symptomatic treatment and other supportive measures. There is no antidote for crizotinib.6 In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that crizotinib is genotoxic, and the Ames test showed that crizotinib was not mutagenic. Carcinogenicity studies with crizotinib have not been performed.4 In female rats, 500 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) of crizotinib for 3 days induced single-cell necrosis of ovarian follicles. In male rats, 50 mg/kg/day of crizotinib (greater than 1.7 times the recommended human dose) for 28 days induced testicular pachytene spermatocyte degeneration.4",

            "Pharmacodynamics": "It exerts an anti-tumor activity in vivo and in vitro against selected sarcoma cells by inhibiting tumor growth by binding to PDGFR-alpha that is present on several types of cancer on transformed cells and in tumor stroma 3. Olaratumab antibody binding leads to inhibition of ligand-dependent signaling in PDGFR(alpha)-expressing tumor cells, as well as stromal cells in the tumor microenviroment that are dependent on PDGFR(alpha) signaling. When used in a combination therapy with doxorubicin, olaratumab improves progression-free survival in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma. ",
            "Mechanism of action": "Olaratumab blocks ligand-induced tumor cell proliferation, and inhibits receptor autophosphorylation and ligand-induced phosphorylation of the downstream signaling molecules protein kinase B (Akt) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 5. PDGFR signalling is a type of tyrosine kinase-mediated pathway that normally regulates cell growth, chemotaxis, and mesenchymal stem cell differentiation.

            "Pharmacodynamics": "Upregulates the expression of MHC I proteins, allowing for increased presentation of peptides derived from viral antigens. This enhances the activation of CD8+ T cells that are the precursors for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and makes the macrophage a better target for CTL-mediated killing. Interferon alpha also induce the synthesis of several key antiviral mediators, including 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (2'-5' A synthetase) and protein kinase R.",
            "Mechanism of action": "Interferon alpha binds to type I interferon receptors (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c) which upon dimerization activate two Jak (Janus kinase) tyrosine kinases (Jak1 and Tyk2). These transphosphorylate themselves and phosphorylate the receptors. The phosphorylated INFAR receptors then bind to Stat1 and Stat2 (signal transducers and activators of transcription)which dimerize and activate multiple (~100) immunomodulatory and antiviral proteins. Interferon alpha binds less stably to type I interferon receptors than interferon beta.TargetActionsOrganismAInterferon alpha/beta receptor 2binderHumansAInterferon alpha/beta receptor 1binderHumans",

In general, the primary effects of an overdose are consistent with the effects seen with therapeutic doses of interferon alfa-2b. Hepatic enzyme abnormalities, renal failure, hemorrhage, and myocardial infarction have been reported with single administration overdoses and/or with longer durations of treatment than prescribed. Toxic effects after ingestion of interferon alfa-2b are not expected because interferons are poorly absorbed orally.",
