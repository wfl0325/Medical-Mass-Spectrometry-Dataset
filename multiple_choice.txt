C. A compound composed of a two cyclic peptides attached to a phenoxazine that is derived from streptomyces parvullus. It binds to DNA and inhibits RNA synthesis (transcription), with chain elongation more sensitive than initiation, termination, or release. As a result of impaired mRNA production, protein synthesis also declines after dactinomycin therapy. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1993, p2015)

Q: What is the Groups of Crizotinib?
A. 64310
B. Approved, Investigational
C. Crizotinib is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors are anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS1-positive as detected by an FDA-approved test.4 Crizotinib is also indicated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory, systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) that is ALK-positive in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older and young adults. The safety and efficacy of crizotinib have not been established in older adults with relapsed or refractory, systemic ALK-positive ALCL.4 Additionally, crizotinib is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with unresectable, recurrent, or refractory inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) that is ALK-positive.4Reduce drug development failure ratesBuild, train, & validate machine-learning modelswith evidence-based and structured datasets.See how  Build, train, & validate predictive machine-learning models with structured datasets.See how
D. Crizotinib is 91% bound to plasma protein. In vitro studies suggest that this is not affected by drug concentration.4

Q: What is the Weight of Crizotinib?
A. Average: 450.337 Monoisotopic: 449.11854397 
B. Avoid grapefruit products. Grapefruit inhibits CYP3A4 metabolism, which may increase the serum levels of crizotinib.Avoid St. John's Wort. This herb induces CYP3A4 metabolism, which may reduce serum levels of crizotinib.Take with or without food. High-fat food decreases drug absorption, but not to a clinically significant extent.

Q: What is the Groups of Interferon alfa-2b?
A. Approved
B. 19271.0 Da
C. Interferon alfa-2b is a form of recombinant human interferon used to treat hepatitis B and C infection, genital warts, hairy cell leukemia, follicular lymphoma, malignant melanoma, and AIDs-related Kaposi's sarcoma.
D. There is limited experience with overdosage. Postmarketing surveillance includes reports of patients receiving a single dose as great as 10 times the recommended dose. In general, the primary effects of an overdose are consistent with the effects seen with therapeutic doses of interferon alfa-2b. Hepatic enzyme abnormalities, renal failure, hemorrhage, and myocardial infarction have been reported with single administration overdoses and/or with longer durations of treatment than prescribed. Toxic effects after ingestion of interferon alfa-2b are not expected because interferons are poorly absorbed orally.

C. Tasonermin is recombinant soluble form tumor necrosis factor α produced via Escherichia coli cell culture. It was approved for use by the European Medicines Agency in April of 1999 for use as an adjunt to surgery for the subsequent removal of the tumor and in palliative care for irresectable soft tissue sarcoma of the limbs as the product Beromun. It is administered with Melphalan via mild hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion.

C. In addition to its intended cytotoxic effects, tasonermin produces secondary adverse effects. Studies in mice, rats, dogs, monkeys, and rabbits observed hematological changes including anemia, increased hematocrit, and changes in leukocyte and platelet counts dependent on species and treatment duration Label.Tasonermin also produces decreases in blood pressure. Increases in heart rate and reductions in cardiac contractility have been noted in some studies.Increased liver enzymes suggest altered liver function as a result of tasonermin administration. Changes in kidney function have also been observed including increased water and sodium excretion as well as increased serum urea and creatinine.The only study to determine a no observable adverse effect level found the value to be 0.1 μg/kg in monkeys during a 7-day course of tasonermin.
