Q: The Toxicity of the Crizotinib is ________.
A: The maximum tolerated dose of crizotinib is the same as the recommended dosing regimen (250 mg twice daily). This was defined based on a phase 1 dose-escalation study in patients with advanced solid tumors. The treatment of crizotinib overdoses should consist of symptomatic treatment and other supportive measures. There is no antidote for crizotinib.6 In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that crizotinib is genotoxic, and the Ames test showed that crizotinib was not mutagenic. Carcinogenicity studies with crizotinib have not been performed.4 In female rats, 500 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) of crizotinib for 3 days induced single-cell necrosis of ovarian follicles. In male rats, 50 mg/kg/day of crizotinib (greater than 1.7 times the recommended human dose) for 28 days induced testicular pachytene spermatocyte degeneration.4
